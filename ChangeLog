* Code review

* Documentation


## 0.8.0 (2021-05-27)

Changes:

* A selection of CSS themes has been created and the `notebook` theme has been
  chosen as the default theme
* It is now possible to override the system-wide CSS
  (`/usr/share/nautilus-annotations/style.css`) by placing a CSS in the home
  directory (`~/.local/share/nautilus-annotations/style.css`) -- the extension
  checks in the home directory first, if no theme is found it falls back to the
  default CSS
* Text wrap has been removed from the "Annotations" column -- the column
  appearance is something that should be managed upstream by Nautilus
* Use of `fprintf()` for message logging has been dropped in favor of GLib's
  `g_message()`
* Code review
* A `with-theme=...` option has been added to the `configure` script for
  selecting a different CSS theme during the build process; with this comes a
  `--without-theme` option too, for relying solely on the current GTK theme and
  not using any extension-specific one
* Internationalization does not depend on **XDG intltool** anymore, but only on
  **GNU gettext**

## 0.6.1 (2021-05-12)

Changes:

* Showing and hiding the discard button is now handled gracefully -- the
  button's CSS class persists between state changes, and this prevents delays
  in the decoration of the widget
* Code review
* Documentation
* A small bug in the build system that caused `make distcheck` not to function
  properly has been fixed


## 0.6.0 (2021-05-10)

Changes:

* Two new keyboard shortcuts have been created (`Ctrl` + `S` and `Shift` +
  `Esc`)

  now documented in `/usr/share/doc/nautilus-annotations/shortcuts.md`

* Code review
* Documentation
